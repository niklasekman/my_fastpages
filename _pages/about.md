I'm a Marine electrician with a software design background currently studying for a Bachelor of Engineering in Electrical Engineering.

When I'm not sweating in a hot engine room, lying on deck plates, while reaching for a bilge level switch amid 100Â°C fuel oil pipes like I'm about to in the picture above, hence the expression, I like to make and experiment. I benefit of having _multiclassed_ in both CS and EE in addition to photography among other things. While my knowledge isn't as deep in any particular subject, I'm backed up by the breadth of things I'm familiar with.
